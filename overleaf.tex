\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Stellar bars are present in the inner region of many disc galaxies in local and high redshift universe. The reported frequency of bars declines from 50\% to 70\% at z=0 to $\sim 20\%$ at z=0.8 in different observational studies(e.g., sheth, et al. 2008). Bar may play important role in driving the secure evolution of disc galaxies by redistributing the gas, stars and even dark matter, as well as the angular momentum associated to these components(see Kormendy 2013, for a review). For instance, bars could induce gas flowing into the galaxy central region and contribute to the formation of pseudo-bulges and bulges. On the other hand, the origin, growth and destroy of bars is a key piece of the secular galaxy evolution puzzle, and many details are still unclear. The answer to this issue could helps to explain the presence or absence of bars in disc galaxies with different properties. 

Bar formation can be either triggered by the internal secular evolution or by external processes, including merge, tidal effects of nearby galaxies. Early theoretical and N-body simulation studies suggested that massive cold stellar disks are highly unstable to disk instability, and bars can grow quickly in these stellar disks(e.g., Ostriker \& Peebles 1973; Toomre 1977b, 1981;...). However, this scenario is likely inaccurate to explain the origin of bars in realistic galaxies, because these studies did not take account of several factors, such as halos, gas component, and physics related to gas, i.e., cooling, star formation and feedback, and the impact of external processes(Athanassoula 2012; Kormendy 2013).  

Later idealized simulation works including halos, gas component and gas physics shows that bar formation may be a gradual process, and both the halos and gas play important roles(e.g. ref see A12 P2, P16 ). Athanassoula(2002) demonstrated that halo would firstly delay bar formation, but then can strengthen the bar during secular evolution by absorbing the angular momentum of stars. The strength of bars in simulated isolate galaxies was found to correlate with the amount of angular momentum absorbed by halos, and depend on the halo central concentrations(Athanassoula \& Misiriotis 2002; Athanassoula 2003). Many simulations shown that gas would obstruct the growth of bar by giving angular momentum to it. Consequently, bars will form much later and are much weaker in gas-rich disc galaxies(e.g., A13 P16, Berentzen et al. 2004; Bournaud, Combes \& Semelin 2005; Berentzen et al. 2007; Athanassoula et al. 2013). tidal? 

These idealized simulations, however, usually study the formation and evolution of bars in isolated disc galaxies. Those disc galaxies were set up at the beginning of simulations assuming varies models, not results of self-consistent evolution. In addition, the effect of tidal force,  if it was included, was modelled in simplified ways. To overcome these two limitations, several works have investigated the origin and development of bars in more realistic environment using cosmological zoom-in simulations(e.g. Kraljic et al. 2012; Scannapieco \& Athanassoula 2012; Spinoso, et al. 2017). These simulations shows that bars can emerge naturally in the concord $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and most of the bars became easily observable only after $z=\sim 0.4-0.5$.

Recently, galaxy formation and evolution in cosmic volume, up to a cubic of 100 Mpc, and high resolution, down to kpc-100pc, have been studied in state-of-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Illustris-1, EAGLE, Illustris-TNG(Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Schaye et al. 2015; Nelson 2018). The properties of bars in disc galaxies in these simulations, including their frequency, origin and correlation with gas fraction, stellar mass have been examined(Algorry et al. 2017; Peschken \& Lokas 2019). Some of the results in different simulations are consistent with each other, and are in agreement with previous simulations and observations, such as the bar fraction decrease with gas fraction, and increase with stellar mass. Nevertheless, some properties, for instance, the bar fraction, show notable differences. Bar fraction in EAGLE is about 40\%, which is generally consistent with observation. But, the fraction in Illustris-1 is much lower, $\sim 21\%$, and increase slightly as redshift increase. 

These discrepancies over bar fraction between simulations may be partially caused by the different baryon physics, such as the feedback from star formation and AGN. It would be worthwhile to carry out a comparison of barred galaxies in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations. As these two simulations share the same initial condition, such a comparison study would find out the impact of baryon physics on the formation and evolution of bars. Note that, during the preparation of this work, Rosas-Guevara et al. (2019) publish their analyse on the bar fraction in Illustris-TNG, which is 40\% and is much higher than the fraction in Illustris.

This paper is organised as follows. We introduce the simulations and galaxies samples in Section \ref{sec:samples}. The overall features of barred galaxies such as the visual impression, bar fractions, and their origin in two simulations are shown in Section 3. We explore the roles of gas fraction, black hole, dark matter halo shape in host galaxies during the evolution of bars in Section 4. A comparison of bar properties between matched galaxies in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations is presented in Section 5. We discuss our findings and comparison with previous works in Scetion 6. We summarize our results in Section 7. 

\section{SIMULATIONS AND Galaxies Samples} \label{sec:samples}
\subsection{The Illustris-1 and TNG100 simulations}
In this paper, we make use of public released data from the Illustris-1 and TNG100 simulations. These two simulations used the same initial condition, which was described in detail in \citep{ }. There were, however, some differences in cosmological parameters and baryon physics between these two simulations.

Illustris project \citep{ } is a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, which used the moving-mesh code AREPO \citep{ }. The cosmological parameters of Illustris simulations are consistent with the latest Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9) measurements \citep{ }: $\Omega_m =\Omega_{dm} + \Omega_b = 0.2726$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.7274, $\Omega_b$ = 0.0456, $\sigma_8$ = 0.809, $n_s$ = 0.963, and $H_0$ = 100$h \ \rm{km}\ {s}^{-1} \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with $h$ = 0.704. The IllustrisTNG project \citep{ } is the successor of the original Illustris simulation, it updates ‘next generation’ galaxy formation model which includes new physics and numerical improvements, as well as refinements to the original Illustris simulations. IllustrisTNG simulations' cosmological parameters are consistent with the recent Planck constraints \citep{ }: $\Omega_m = 0.3089$, $\Omega_b$ = 0.0486, $\Omega_\lambda$ = 0.6911, $\sigma_8$ = 0.8159, $n_s$ = 0.9667, $h$ = 0.6774.

Illstris-1 and TNG100 simulations have the same side lengths 75$h^{-1}$ $\approx$ 100 Mpc, both used a number of $2 \times 1820^3$ dark matter and gas particles. The mass of each dark matter and gas particle are $6.3 \time 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and $1.6 \time 10^6 M_{\odot}$ in Illustris-1, and $6.3 \time 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and $1.4 \time 10^6 M_{\odot}$ in TNG100. Both simulation evolve from a starting redshift z = 127 to the present time z = 0. Illustris-1 simulation produce 134 snapshots, while TNG100 has 100 snapshots.

differences in baryon physics?

\subsection{Galaxies Samples}
We make use of Illustris and IllustrisTNG public released data, including SubFind Subhalo catalog \citep{ } and the SubLink merger tree, it let us to know how each halo evolved over time. In Illustris project, galaxy is named as Subhalo, and dark matter halo is named Halo. 

We basically follow the method in Peschken \& Lokas(2019) to find barred galaxies in simulation samples. 
In order to study the bars, one shall first locate the disk galaxies. 
\citep{N. Peschken} used two parameters provided by the simulations to determine disk galaxies, i.e., the stellar circularities, $\epsilon$, and the flatness of galaxies. 
Star particles that belonging to galaxy disc are expected to have circularity parameter $\epsilon$ close to 1. 
Moreover, the IllustrisTNG projects provided the fractional mass $f_\epsilon$ of stellar particles with $\epsilon > 0.7$ for each galaxy. 
This was first given by Genel(2015) \citep{ } as a measure of the fraction of stellar mass in the disc component. 
If a galaxy has more than 20\% of their stellar mass have $\epsilon > 0.7$, i.e., $f_\epsilon>0.2$, this galaxy will be identified as a disk galaxy. 
In addition, the flatness of a disk galaxies should be less than 0.7. 
This parameter was calculated from axis ratios and the eigenvalues of the stellar mass tensor. 
Stellar circularities and galaxy flastness datas we used are provided by Genel \citep{ }.
(???Values provided by Illustris and Illustris-TNG or calculated by own code?) DONE.

We have used the method to select disk galaxies in the simulation samples at redshift z = 0. In TNG-100, we found 2658 disk galaxies with stellar mass greater than  $10^{10} M_\odot$, and 1269 disk galaxies with stellar particles more than 40000. 

The numbers of disk galaxies are almost the same with the Illustris-1 data, which we found 1232 disk galaxies with over 40000 stellar particles. 
(please provide exact number!) DONE.

Then we used the $A_2$ parameter \citep{} to identify whether a disc galaxy has a bar or not. $A_2$ is defined from the Fourier components(Athanassoula et al 2013): 
\begin{equation}
    a_m(R) = \sum_{i}^{N_R}M_{i}cos(m\phi_i)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    b_m(R) = \sum_{i}^{N_R}M_{i}sin(m\phi_i)
\end{equation}
where $N_R$ is the number of star particles inside a given cylindrical radius R, $M_i$ is the $i$-th star particle's mass, and $\phi_i$ is its azimuthal angle \citep{ }.
$A_2(R)$ is a function of cylindrical radius R. We measure the bar strength by using $A_2(R)$ maximum value $A^{max}_2$.
\begin{equation}
    A_2(R) = \frac{\sqrt{a_{2}^{2} + b_{2}^{2}}}{a_0}
\end{equation}
\citep{ } had found that in Illustris-1, many galaxies with A2 parameter between 0.15 and 0.2 that visually clearly show a bar, and we came to the same result in Illustris-TNG. (what is the meaning of this sentence???)
So we calculate all disk galaxies' A2 parameter, and used the threshold value of 0.15 in the A2 parameter to determine whether a galaxy is barred or not. Further more, we carry a visual inspection to the images of galaxies with A2 larger than 0.15 to check if they're barred or not. We identify 110 and 698 barred galaxies in Illustris-1 and TNG100 respectively at z=0. 

\section{Result} 
\subsection{Galaxy images}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\plotone{figures/barfig.pdf}
\caption{Bar fraction as a function of stellar mass in the Illustris-1(green filled circle) and TNG100(red filled circle) simulations. Histogram of the stellar mass of 2658 disk galaxies with $M_* > 10^{10}M_\odot$ in the TNG100 is shown in cyan color.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

By checking the galaxy images at redshift $z=0$, we eliminated some galaxy that A2 parameters over 0.15 but do not look like barred visually.
In Fig.1, we divide the images by different stellar mass and compared galaxies between two simulations. 
We find that galaxies in TNG simulation look more like real barred galaxies than galaxies in Illustris-1 simulation, especially in the low mass bins. 
We can see that small galaxy (have less than 40000 stellar particles) in Illustris-1 its A2 parameter over 0.15, but doesn't look like a real barred disk galaxy. 
However, small galaxy in TNG simulation looks much regular.

In order to better compare the differences between the two simulations,
we decide not to use small galaxies data, just like \citep{ } work.

Histogram in both figures are the stellar masses of galaxies in that simulation, bin size: 0.083. Green dots are bar fraction data from \citep{D´ıaz-Garc´ıa .2016}.
}

\end{figure}

(include previous results, simulation and observation) DONE.

We see in Fig.2 that the fraction of barred galaxies in TNG simulation is much higher than Illustris-1 simulation in all mass bins at redshift $z=0$.
And than we calculated the disk galaxies' A2 parameter in several redshift of snapshots(Fig.3), find that in TNG simulation, the fraction doesn't change over redshift. 
This result is completely different with Illustris-1 simulation.
The divergence of bar fraction between two simulations is shown in each redshift.

\section{Impact of gas fraction, black hole and dark matter halo} 
\subsection{SFR and Gas fraction}
Fig.4 histogram of the gas fraction of disk galaxies in two simulations. 
It's shown that the gas fraction of disk galaxies in TNG are generally lower than galaxies in Illustris-1 simulation at redshift z=0. 
And, even in the same gas fraction bin, galaxy bar fraction in TNG are much higher than in Illustris-1.
So we choose these barred galaxies at redshift z=0 as our default sample to trace bar formation and galaxy evolutionary history.

Fig.6 shown the default samples gas fraction(inside the twice of half mass radius) evolve with redshift.
Left line represents TNG's galaxies, right line represents Illustris-1 galaxies.
We find that galaxies gas fraction in TNG simulation are lower than galaxies in Illustris-1 at each redshift. 
The unbarred galaxies in Illustris-1 simulation have the highest gas fraction compare to others samples. 
Seems like galaxy bar formation and evolution will be suspended by gas component inside disk galaxy.
Some simulations \citep{E. Athanassoula et. al. 2012} about bar formation in secular evolution have the same result.

Generally speaking, if galaxy contain large amounts of gas will trigger intense star formation activity.
However, barred galaxies in Illustris-1 simulation have a significant higher star formation rate,
even though their gas fraction are relatively low in the statistics.
(Maybe in Illustris-1 star forming cause strong feedback event,  it become the main reason of the disk galaxy gas component outflow.)

\subsection{Black hole mass and accretion rate}
We also trace the evolution of default sample's central supermassive black hole. 
Fig.8 shows that barred galaxies in both simulation have similar black hole mass,
but BH mass of unbarred disk galaxies in Illustris-1 are extremely low.

This divergence of mass of galaxy central supermassive black hole is because barred galaxies' black hole accretion rates are higher than unbarred galaxies at higher redshifts, 
The relationship between black hole accretion rates and redshifts is revealed in Fig.9.

\section{evolution of bars in matched halos } 
\subsection{Halo match algorithm}
In order to understand differences in the disk galaxy formation and galaxy bar evolution, 
we used the Lagrangian region matching algorithm of \cite{Lovell et al. (2014).} to identify pairs of analogue disk galaxies across the two simulations.
This algorithm match halo base on comparing halo's Lagrangian regions in initial condition(ICs) of different simulation and check that they overlap.

\subsection{Matched galaxy samples}
We selected all disk galaxies with over 40000 stellar particles, and try to match their counterparts in another simulation. 
Finally, we matched 1079 galaxies, most of them has different morphology in different simulations.
Table.1 is the matched galaxies morphology distribution.
We will focus on the case that disk galaxy was barred in one simulation but it's counterpart in another simulation didn't form bar structure.
